        The thesis of Frank Chimero’s article “What Screens Want” is the concept of “flux” as a core component for
        designing for screens. In the opening of the article, Chimero writes- “Designing for screens is managing that
        change. To put a finer head on it, the grain of screens is something I call flux.” (Chimero). Chimero highlights
        this change in the digital realm as structural changes, through responsiveness, customization, and variability.
        It is through digital screens where he believes these changes can be most implemented and should be the basis
        for user interface design.

        With the two ideological camps flat and skeuomorphic, I think I would side similarly to Chimero’s take, where he
        writes that there are both benefits and downsides to each- but ultimately it is up to personal aesthetic choice.
        “ Screens are aesthetically neutral, so the looks of things are not a part of their grain.” (Chimero) Personally
        I prefer flat designs and interfaces, I think they stay relevant for longer, whereas skeuomorphic designs tend
        to feel dated faster. Originally skeuomorphic interfaces were necessary to convey the visual information to
        users, but as we progress further in a digital world I feel users are becoming more aware of visual cues giving
        designers more autonomy to take design risks.

        Zoopraxiscope is an early concept device that was used to project moving images. In Chimero’s article he
        explains that “what you’re watching is a volume of traveling light, and that light needs to land on something to
        show itself. This is one of the origins of screens.” (Chimero) Zoopraxiscope relates to web and interaction by
        showcasing how animating images can lead to viewers/users gaining visual information. An example of filmmaking
        can be seen in the storyboard process, the counterpart in design would be creating a wireframe for a design or
        interface. The process of planning out a film and camera shots in a storyboard can be translated to when
        designers sequence out an interface in a wireframe.
