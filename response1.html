        What is the thesis of this article?
        <br>
        <br>
        In J.R Carpenter’s article, they write about the desire to correlate a more hands-on approach to coding, one
        similar to print materials like collage, magazines, etc. More specifically they introduce the core concept of
        the “handmade web”, which they explain as “web pages coded by hand rather than by software; web pages made and
        maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or corporations;” (Carpenter). This push for a more handmade
        approach to web development, stems from Carpenter’s desire to resists the commercialization of the internet,
        with large companies infiltrating the early-web space and eradicating the individualization of web design.

        Carpenter describes the handmade web as a form of resistance. In your own words, what is being resisted?
        <br>
        <br>
        J.R Carpenter refers to handmade web as a space for individualism and internet art. It is their belief that the
        act of creating unique and individualistic web pages is a direct form of resistance towards the modern
        developments of the web. One that follows current trends, and is used more for gaining and sharing information,
        rather than creating art or reflections of the self. The handmade web through Carpenter, is seen as a
        preservation of the early-web personalization and to resist the trends of modern web. In A Handmade Web,
        Carpenter writes “I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to advocate for an ongoing active engagement with the
        making of web pages and of web policies.” (Carpenter)

        Reflecting on your own experiences, what are other examples of drawing attention to the "physicality" of the
        web?
        <br>
        <br>
        One example I think of when referring to preserving and drawing attention to the physicality of the web is
        MySpace. Although it is not as popular as it once was, the original idea and aesthetics of MySpace promoted
        individuality and offered customization that drew from early-web mindsets. You were able to code and adjust your
        page to make it look like your own; taking on a handmade approach to the web. This push for individualism,
        allowed users on MySpace to have a platform to showcase their interests and style on their own terms. Sadly I
        think this example is not a current one, but it was the closest I could think of for a modern example.
